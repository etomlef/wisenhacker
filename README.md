## Final Project Proposal

### Code Books

#### Background:

Programming! There are many free online resources one can utilize to learn web development or programming in general. But it gets confusing trying to remember what you've completed, looked at, tried, where you left off, etc. Jobs, life, kids, partners, cats, chinese takeout.. all get in the way.

Recently, an old Stackoverflow project of free programming resources was adopted, updated, and moved to Github. I want to create a web app that pulls from this list, asks you what you'd like to learn, and then gives you a step-by-step roadmap of tutorials to complete. As each resource is checked off, your profile would update to reflect the resources you've completed. Users can also comment on the resources to give feedback on utility, difficulty, etc.

#### Initial Functionality

1. Login
2. Check off what you want to learn
3. List of Resources is generated for you.
4. Check them off as you complete them.
5. Rate them, 1 - 5 stars for Utility and 1 - 5 for Difficulty.
6. Comment on them.
7. View master list of resources
8. View other user profiles

#### Will need to create

- Home page
- About page
- User Profiles (Pull from Github profile?)
	- Name
	- Bio
	- Contact / Social
	- List of resources currently working on
- Resources
	- Category
	- Title
	- Description
	- Link
	- Rating
	- Comments

#### Hope to eventually create

- App nags you when you don't check off resources in a timely manner
- User can set the timeframe to complete something before nagging kicks in
- Location functionality. Can search for users who live nearby and are studying the same topic, and arrange in-person study groups.
- Order of resources will eventually be by rating/difficulty
